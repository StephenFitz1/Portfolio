        What can you do to help yourself or a loved one with a gambling problem?
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Setting limits for yourself is one way to decrease the impact of gambling. Know when enough is enough, count your losses and go home. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Many betting shops allow self exclusion. If you find it difficult to stay out of the bookies, ask the workers behind the counter to exclude you from their shops. 
            This will mean that they will deny you entry into their shop for up to six months.
        </li>
