        Smoking in Ireland
    </h2>
    
    <div class  = "p">
        <p>
            Cigarette smoke contains over 4,000 chemicals, including apporixmately 69 known carcinogetic chemicals also.
            Nicotine is one of the main ingredients in a cigarette and it is highly addictive. Nicotine reaches the 
            brain within 6 seconds. Cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide, which is colourless, odorless and poisoness.
        </p>
        <br>
        Smoking has caused many issues in Ireland as smoking has become more popular with the younger generation over the last few years.
        This issue spans from underage teenagers being bought cigarettes by friends or family, or even random strangers on the street.

        What can you do to help yourself or a loved one to get over a smoking addiction?
    </h2>
    
    <ul>
        <li>
            Firstly you have to recognise that what you have is an addiction. After this, you can start with your first steps to giving up the habit. 
        </li>
        <br>
        <li>
            Next thing you have to do is inform friends and family about what you're about to go through so they can be there for moral support and help
            you when you are finding it tough. It is especially difficult when it comes to tell you other smoking friends that you plan to quit but if they 
            cared for your wellbeing, they would help and might even join you in the journey themselves.
        </li>
