            Gambling in Ireland

                Gambling has become one of the most rampant addictions in Ireland in the past fifty years.
                With easy access to a bookmaker's in almost any town, many people who may be suffering in other ways in
                their lives use gambling to create a sense of hope. This can quickly lead to a dangerous downward spiral]
                of constantly searching for their next big win. 
            </p>
            <br>
            Unfortunately, this can lead to neglecting responsibilities, missing out on social events, time with your
            family and loved ones. The worst thing of all is that the betting shops use any and every tactic to keep you 
            either betting in their shops or betting online. In comparison to other industries, gambling companies will 
            entice you to keep betting as regularly as possible by offering deals and discounts.

            What can you do to help yourself or a loved one with a gambling problem?
        </h2>
        
        <ul>
            <li>
                Setting limits for yourself is one way to decrease the impact of gambling. Know when enough is enough, count your losses and go home. 
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                Many betting shops allow self exclusion. If you find it difficult to stay out of the bookies, ask the workers behind the counter to exclude you from their shops. 
                This will mean that they will deny you entry into their shop for up to six months.
